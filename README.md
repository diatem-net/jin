# Jin

Jin is a lightweight PHP framework built as a toolbox. The goal is to address specific development issues by offering integrable solutions in diverse open source CMS environments. The idea is to limit the multi-specialization by offering a transversal and modular solution.

> **Disclaimer**  
> Even if most of the code has been written in English,  
> Jin has been mostly documented in French.  
> Feel free to open issues for English translation.
